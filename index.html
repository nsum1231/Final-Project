            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>I'm super glad that you are here and are able to see into my life a little bit through this platform.  The picture that I have included on this page is of my family.  They are truly the most important people in my life and they consistently influence the positive trajectory in my life.  As a person I love making real meaningful connections with others and that has motivated me to push outsideof my comfort zone more than once.  Growing up I came to love participating in student government because of the opportunities that it provided me to connect with others and make a difference in their school experience.  Through those opportunities I forged strong relationships with different teachers and mentors that inspired to pursue things in my life that before I might have pushed off.  After High School I chose to serve a 2 year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and was called to labor in the Aguascalientes, Mexico Mission.  In those 2 years my perspective on this life and my future changed drastically, to this day I continue to think on and learn from the experiences I had teaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  In my future I hope to have a family and be able to follow exactly what God has planned for me.</p>
